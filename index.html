        "I was up a creek when I realized I had forgotten a very specific
        ritualistic dagger and our sacrifical ceremony was only a few hours
        away! I called Cultist Depot and they got me the dagger in the blink of
        an eye! Literally. I don't know how they did it, and, quite frankly, I
        don't want to know. 10/10!"
